Task 3.4: Add contextual navigation from habit rows to detail

Summary: Added optional onDelete callback to HabitSlotRow. When provided, a right-click context menu with a destructive 'Delete' option appears. Wired the delete action in ConfigurationView's ForEach to call viewModel.removeHabit(). Tap-to-open-sheet was already functional from Phase 2.

Files modified:
- ductiva/HabitSlotRow.swift — Added onDelete callback, .contextMenu with Delete button
- ductiva/ConfigurationView.swift — Passed onDelete closure to HabitSlotRow in ForEach
- ductivaTests/HabitSlotRowTests.swift — Added 3 tests: callback acceptance, nil default, body render with callback

Why: Users need to delete habit slots from the configuration screen via right-click context menu.
