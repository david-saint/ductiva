Task 4.6: Verify >80% overall coverage

Summary: Added targeted tests to improve code coverage from 80.76% to 81.82%.
Key improvements:
- ConfigurationViewModel: 71.43% → 95.24% (added seedSampleHabitsIfEmpty tests)
- StealthToggle: new test file with smoke and rendering tests
- AddSlotSheet: added state default tests and schedule type rendering tests

Coverage breakdown (app target):
- Overall: 81.82% (1161/1419)
- ConfigurationViewModel: 95.24%
- ConfigurationView: 85.54%
- ActionBar: 92.11%
- HabitSlotRow: 89.55%
- AddSlotButton: 88.52%
- HabitStore: 100%
- Habit: 97.30%
- SettingsSection: 100%
- Placeholders: 100%

Remaining below 80%: AddSlotSheet (66%) and StealthToggle (77%) — both have
uncovered code in deep nested SwiftUI interactive closures that require UI tests.

Created files:
- ductivaTests/StealthToggleTests.swift

Modified files:
- ductivaTests/ConfigurationViewModelTests.swift
- ductivaTests/AddSlotSheetTests.swift

Why: Phase 4 requirement to verify >80% overall code coverage.
