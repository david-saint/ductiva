Manual verification plan:
The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

Manual Verification Steps:
1. Start the app from Xcode by running the `ductiva` scheme (Cmd+R).
2. In Configuration, right-click any habit row and choose `Mark Completed Today`, then choose it again to toggle back.
3. Confirm that you see: the row completion indicator changes immediately between empty and filled circle states.
4. Click the same habit row to open streak details and confirm `CURRENT STREAK` / `PERFECT DAYS` values reflect completion toggles.
5. Confirm accessibility behavior with VoiceOver: month navigation buttons announce purpose, scheduled day dots announce date/completion state, and metrics announce values clearly.

User confirmation:
User requested to proceed with completion workflow on 2026-02-19 ("proceed").
