Task: Define the Habit model with SwiftData attributes

Summary:
- Added the core SwiftData Habit domain model with persisted fields for name, createdAt, schedule, and completions.
- Added typed schedule representations (daily, weekly, specific days) and weekday support.
- Added a unit test target and initial model test that verifies Habit initialization behavior.

Files changed:
- ductiva/Habit.swift
- ductivaTests/HabitModelTests.swift
- ductiva.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

Why:
- This establishes the foundational persisted habit entity required by the track and enables TDD for subsequent persistence and UI tasks.
