Task: Fix ModelContainer loading error in Widget
Summary: Modified SharedContainer.make() to set allowsSave: false when running in the App Extension.
Files modified/created:
- ductiva/SharedContainer.swift
Why: macOS widgets often fail with SwiftDataError error 1 if they attempt to open an App Group SQLite database with write permissions while the main app has it locked. Making the widget container read-only resolves this.
