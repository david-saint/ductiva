Task 2.3: Apply Liquid Glass styling to interactive elements

Summary:
- Added @State private isHovered to HabitSlotRow for hover tracking
- Extracted rowContent for clean view composition per SwiftUI skill guidelines
- Applied glass material background + glass stroke overlay on hover with opacity transition
- Used .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2), value: isHovered) for smooth glass transitions
- Flat by default (no glass), glass appears on hover — matches design spec
- Added 2 tests for theme constants used by hover effect
- All 36 tests pass

Files modified:
- ductiva/HabitSlotRow.swift (hover glass effect)
- ductivaTests/HabitSlotRowTests.swift (2 new tests)
