Task group: Phase 4 integration and refinement

Summary:
- Added HabitStore completion-day helpers (isCompleted/toggleCompletion) and wired ConfigurationViewModel methods to toggle and query today's completion.
- Updated main Configuration row rendering to display completion state and expose completion toggling in the row context menu.
- Added tests validating completion toggling behavior and immediate streak snapshot updates.
- Audited and refined streak UI typography/spacing to align with Stealth Ceramic style (tracking emphasis, monospaced display typography).
- Completed accessibility pass for streak detail and row controls (labels/hints for calendar navigation, day dots, metrics, and row completion status).

Why:
Ensure streak data and UI stay in sync with daily completion toggles while finalizing design and accessibility quality for the completed streak tracker feature.
