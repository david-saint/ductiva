Task: Create HabitCalendarViewTests.swift

Summary:
- Added new functional view test suite for the habit streak UI layer.
- Introduced creation/render tests for HabitCalendarGridView, HabitMetricsView, and HabitStreakDetailView.
- Confirmed Red phase by running only HabitCalendarViewTests and observing expected compile failures for missing view types.

Files:
- ductivaTests/HabitCalendarViewTests.swift

Why:
Define the expected UI surface before implementation so Phase 3 follows TDD from failing tests to concrete view code.
