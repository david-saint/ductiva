Task: Verify the initial UI aligns with the "Stealth Ceramic" and "Liquid Glass" guidelines

Summary:
- Added explicit visual theme tokens for chassis color, glass material, corner radius, and text/stroke treatment.
- Styled the habit list and detail surfaces with translucent material cards over a matte graphite gradient background.
- Preserved calm, direct empty/detail messaging and reinforced visual hierarchy through contrast and layered depth.
- Added unit tests that validate guideline-critical design tokens.

Files:
- ductiva/StealthCeramicTheme.swift (created)
- ductiva/ContentView.swift (modified)
- ductivaTests/StealthCeramicThemeTests.swift (created)

Why:
- Converts Phase 3 UI from functional baseline into product-aligned presentation matching the required "Stealth Ceramic & Liquid Glass" direction while keeping implementation testable and maintainable.
