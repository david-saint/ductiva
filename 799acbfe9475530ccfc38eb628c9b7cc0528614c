Task: Implement basic CRUD operations for habits

Summary:
- Added a dedicated HabitStore abstraction over SwiftData ModelContext.
- Implemented create, fetch, update, and delete operations for Habit entities.
- Added CRUD-focused unit tests to validate persistence behavior through the store API.

Files:
- ductiva/HabitStore.swift (created)
- ductivaTests/HabitStoreCRUDTests.swift (created)

Why:
- Centralizes Habit persistence logic behind a small, testable boundary so Phase 3 UI integration can depend on a stable data API.
