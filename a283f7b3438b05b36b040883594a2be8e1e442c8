Task: Update the main view to display a simple list of habits from SwiftData

Summary:
- Replaced the default Item-driven ContentView with a Habit-driven SwiftData query and list.
- Added a shared fetch descriptor for habits (newest first) and schedule description formatting for UI text.
- Added an empty-state view and lightweight detail panel showing selected habit information.
- Added focused unit tests validating fetch ordering and schedule text formatting used by ContentView.

Files:
- ductiva/ContentView.swift (modified)
- ductivaTests/ContentViewHabitListTests.swift (created)

Why:
- Integrates the persistence layer into the main app surface so habit data is visible immediately, establishing the baseline UI for further product/aesthetic refinement in Phase 3.
