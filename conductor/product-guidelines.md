# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic: "Stealth Ceramic & Liquid Glass"
A high-contrast interplay between industrial density and fluid transparency. 
- **Chassis:** Grounded in "Stealth Ceramic"—matte-milled graphite (#1C1C1E)—for a dense, industrial feel.
- **Encapsulation:** Layered with "Liquid Glass" to ensure a seamless fit into macOS design patterns, utilizing translucency and depth.

## Tone of Voice: "Calm & Stoic"
Minimal, non-intrusive language that promotes focus and long-term habit building. The messaging should be direct and clear, avoiding unnecessary flair to maintain a distraction-free experience.

## Design Patterns & UI Elements
- **Layering & Depth:** Use "Stealth Ceramic" for primary UI controls and "Liquid Glass" for high-contrast, translucent overlays to create a clear hierarchy.
- **Motion & Interaction:** Implement fluid transitions and subtle hover effects that emphasize the "Liquid Glass" transparency, enhancing the modern macOS-native feel.
