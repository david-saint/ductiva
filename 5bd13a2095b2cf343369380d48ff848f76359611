Task: Implement Widget Configuration Intent
Summary: Created AppIntent for selecting a Habit and enabled sharing of Core Data / SwiftData models across both targets.
Files modified/created:
- ductiva/Habit.swift
- ductiva/SharedContainer.swift
- ductiva/ductivaApp.swift
- ductivaTests/SharedDataTests.swift
- ductivaWidgets/HabitSelectionIntent.swift
- project.pbxproj
Why: The widget needs to be able to fetch and configure which habits to show, which requires exposing the models and AppIntent configurations.
