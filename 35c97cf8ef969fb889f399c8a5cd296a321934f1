Task: Create Shared Widget UI Components
Summary: Adapted existing UI components for Widget compatibility and added a new styling modifier.
Files modified/created:
- ductiva/HabitCompletionRingView.swift
- ductivaWidgets/WidgetLiquidGlassModifier.swift
- project.pbxproj
Why: Widgets need to render rings statically since TimelineView animation isn't fully supported the same way, and they need to conform to the Liquid Glass design guidelines.
