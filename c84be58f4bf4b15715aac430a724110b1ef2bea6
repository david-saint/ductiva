Summary:

- Integrated fire visual behavior in metrics (flame icon, warm color palette, pulse animation) when threshold is active.
- Added HabitStreakDetailView composing history header, calendar grid, and metrics panel.
- Replaced ConfigurationView streak sheet content from placeholder to HabitStreakDetailView.
