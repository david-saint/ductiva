Task 4.4: Refine animations and transitions

Summary: Added animation refinements to the habit slot list:
- List VStack animates with .easeInOut driven by viewModel.habits.count
- Individual habit rows have opacity+move(edge: .top) transition
- AddSlotButton has opacity transition for smooth appear/disappear
- Add and remove operations wrapped in withAnimation for explicit animation
- Hover effects already implemented in HabitSlotRow and AddSlotButton
- Sheet presentation uses default SwiftUI animation (no changes needed)

Modified files:
- ductiva/ConfigurationView.swift — Added animation modifiers and transitions

Why: Per Phase 4 plan, ensures smooth visual feedback for all list mutations.
