Task 4.1: Create SettingsSection (inline toggles)

Summary: Extracted inline settings toggle rows from ConfigurationView into a
standalone SettingsSection view. The view takes @Binding parameters for
launchAtLogin and showInMenuBar and renders them using StealthToggle with
Stealth Ceramic theme styling. Static label constants exposed for testability.

Created files:
- ductiva/SettingsSection.swift — Standalone settings toggle view
- ductivaTests/SettingsSectionTests.swift — 7 tests (smoke, bindings, labels)

Modified files:
- ductiva/ConfigurationView.swift — Replaced inline settings with SettingsSection

Why: Improves view composition by extracting settings into a reusable,
testable component per Phase 4 plan.
