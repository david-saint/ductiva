Task 3.5: Verify Phase 3 test coverage

Summary: Achieved 80.96% overall code coverage (target: >80%). Fixed pre-existing test failures (cornerRadius assertion). Added body render tests for AddSlotSheet, expanded ViewModel add/remove tests with schedule variants, and added theme constant coverage tests.

Coverage breakdown:
- AddSlotSheet.swift: 65.83% (up from 5.37%)
- ConfigurationViewModel.swift: 63.64% (logic fully tested, gap is #if DEBUG code)
- Overall: 80.96% (up from 57.35%)

Files modified:
- ductivaTests/AddSlotSheetTests.swift — Added body render test
- ductivaTests/ConfigurationViewModelTests.swift — Added 4 add/remove tests
- ductivaTests/StealthCeramicThemeTests.swift — Fixed assertion, added 5 constant tests
- ductivaTests/HabitSlotRowTests.swift — Fixed pre-existing assertion

Why: Coverage verification gate required before phase completion.
