Task group: Habit streak tracker core logic + calendar view model

Summary:
- Added HabitStreakService with schedule-aware streak computation, perfect-day counting, completion lookup, and fire-threshold logic.
- Added HabitCalendarViewModel + HabitCalendarDayState for month grid generation, month navigation, scheduled/completed/today flags.
- Added and expanded unit tests for streak logic and calendar behavior including month navigation, scheduled-day detection, today marking, and month/year correctness.

Files:
- ductiva/HabitStreakService.swift
- ductiva/HabitCalendarViewModel.swift
- ductivaTests/HabitStreakServiceTests.swift
- ductivaTests/HabitCalendarViewModelTests.swift

Why:
Provide the data/logic foundation required by the track spec so the upcoming UI replacement can render correct streak and calendar states across schedules.
